Time series data refers to an ordered sequence or a set of data points that a variable takes at equal time intervals. The stock market is considered to be one of the most highly complex financial systems which consist of various components or stocks, the price of which fluctuates greatly with respect to time.
This project tries to analyze the time series data of the Indian stock market and build a statistical model that could efficiently predict the future stocks.
This project uses an ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model for prediction of stock market movement.
The data needed for the project is fetched from the NSE through the nsepy module as and when required, and hence the data used is live data.
